# project-skysurvey
Skysurvey is a multi-term DALI Lab project in partnership with Dartmouth professor Ryan Hickox. 
This project aims to build an online database that contains survey coverage maps and metadata for as many survey fields as possible, and displays them using polygons on a map of the sky.
